# ListBot

I created this Discord chatbot in my senior year of highschool so that my friends and I could plan events better in our private Discord community. We no longer suffer the experience texting the group: "Who is coming to the party?" and then checking the text channel an hour later and sifting through a sea of messages about a completely unrelated topic because someone started a conversation about starfish in the event planning channel... I digress. 

Now, all one has to do to plan a party is use this bot to create a list and send a notification out to the group. Then members of the community are free to add themselves to the Yes, No, and Maybe sections of the list. Then, rather than sifting through starfish puns to see who is coming, not coming, or might be coming, you ask the bot to show you the list in one convientient package.

Further, those who add themselves to the Yes section of a list, are given a custom role so that if all attendees need to be given an urgent notification such as a cancellation or room change, they and they alone can be sent a notifcation instead of sending a notification to all members of the community.

Finally, users are able to set community specific nicknames for themselves, so the list will display the name "Omer" instead of "FlammingOstrich" (in my case).

(These roles were automatically generated when the list was created and assigned to users who added themselves to the yes section.)
